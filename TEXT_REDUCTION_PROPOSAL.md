# Text Reduction & Scannability Improvements

## Current Issues (from image analysis):

1. **"VARFÖR DENNA ÖVNING?"** - Dense paragraph, hard to scan
2. **"HUR FACILITERA?"** - Three very long paragraphs (Setup, Guidance, Pacing) - overwhelming
3. **"SKRIPT"** - Many long paragraphs, hard to distinguish script from notes
4. **Overall** - Too much information visible at once

## Proposed Solutions:

### 1. Make "HUR FACILITERA?" Collapsible
- Like "FORSKNINGSBAKGRUND", make it collapsible by default
- Practitioners can expand when needed
- Reduces initial cognitive load

### 2. Break Down "VARFÖR DENNA ÖVNING?"
- Convert dense paragraph into 2-3 bullet points
- Use bold for key phrases
- More scannable format

### 3. Improve "HUR FACILITERA?" Content Structure
- Break long paragraphs into shorter chunks
- Use bullet points for key actions
- Add visual separators between sub-sections
- Make it more actionable, less narrative

### 4. Better Script Formatting in Detail Mode
- Clearer separation between script phrases and practitioner notes
- Shorter line breaks
- Better visual hierarchy

### 5. Progressive Disclosure Strategy
- Default state: Only essential info visible
- Expandable sections: Research, Facilitation Notes
- Script Mode: Only what to say (no notes)

### 6. Visual Improvements
- More white space between sections
- Better typography hierarchy
- Icons for quick scanning
- Shorter section headers
